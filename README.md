# TechTrain-NLP

## Course Overview

This NLP course is structured to be both comprehensive and concise, emphasizing:
- Key NLP concepts and challenges
- State-of-the-art model architectures and techniques
- Practical exercises using Python and popular NLP libraries

The course aims to provide a balance between theory and hands-on experience, guiding participants through tasks such as tokenization, embeddings, and model fine-tuning, with each session building upon the previous one.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into three primary sessions:
	1.	Session 1: Introduction to NLP
 * NLP problems, tokenization, and preprocessing
 * Introduction to RNN models
 * Practical exercises using tokenizers and basic NLP models
	2.	Session 2: Fine-Tuning NLP Models
   * Understanding BERT and Transformer architectures
* Practical hands-on fine-tuning with BERT
	3.	Session 3: Optimization and Model Evaluation
* Advanced model optimization techniques
* Practical tasks with multiple small exercises focusing on optimizing models for performance

Each session includes Jupyter Notebooks containing structured exercises, practical code snippets, and solution explanations.

**Dependencies**

This repository requires Python 3.8+ and the following packages:
* transformers
* torch
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
